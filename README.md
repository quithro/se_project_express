# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
This project ties into the previous WTWR (What to Wear?) project as a functioning back-end. It can add, create and like items posted.

I've implemented several new technologies and techniques such as Express.js, REST API, Server-Side Engineering with Node.js, and a new way to handle errors.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
